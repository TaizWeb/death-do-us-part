# Death Do Us Part
> A game about true love

## What is this?
Originally, a jam game. Though I felt later that the concepts were neat and I wanted to expand upon it more, so I'm now developing it in my spare time

## When will it be done?
No clue! My schedule is sporadic at best so I'll work on it when I can. Hopefully I'll add something daily. When it _is_ finished I'll put a link to the itch page.
